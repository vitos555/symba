SymbA
=====


SymbA (Symbolic Algebra) is a framework for symbolic mathematics. The main goal of this project is to have an embedable library which can do basic symbolic manipulations needed for geometric algebra and geometric mechanics.

SymbA was started as a next iteration of symbolic library. Main motivation was to have enough functionality to develop custom variational integrators. Copyright on current version belongs to Vitalii Ostrovskyi.
